The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Guides

### Structure

- components go to
  - `components/atoms` - if they do one thing only and include base html tags only
  - `components/molecules` - if they do more than one thing or consist of more than 1 atom
  - `components/organisms` - if they consist of more than 1 molecule and/or atom
  - `pages` if they are the landing page of an URI

### How to use translation

- open translations/translation.ts file
- add your translation following the pattern:

```typescript
{
  uniqueKey: {
    [Language.ENGLISH]: 'English translation',
    [Language.SPANISH]: 'Spanish translation',
  }
}
```

- where you want to use it, include the translate function using: (where useTranslate is imported from `hooks/useTranslate.ts`)

```typescript
const t = useTranslate();
```

- to use the translated string use (uniqueKey represents the uniqueKey given in the steps above)

```typescript
t("uniqueKey");
```

example:

```typescript
// translations.ts
export const translations = {
  helloWorld: {
    [Language.ENGLISH]: "Hello World",
    [Language.SPANISH]: "Hola Mundo",
  },
};

// App.tsx
const App: React.FC = () => {
  const t = useTranslate();

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>{t("helloWorld")}</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Routing

To add new page follow the pattern established in `router/routes.ts` and add new element to the routes object. Look at the comments on the `Route` interface declaration.

## State

There is a global state defined in `state/GlobalState.ts` which can be accessed at any point in the application and get the state written in the class.

## Deployment

Currently the repository is set to be push-mirrored in GitHub (https://github.com/mutafow/esparta_gitlab_mirror). The reason for doing so is that GitHub provides free and quick integration with Vercel. Vercel is a platform for frontend frameworks and static sites. It automatically sets up pipelines and environments, so that you can set it up in with just a few clicks. The front-end is currently hosted at https://esparta-webpro.vercel.app/ but will be probably taken down after WEBPRO is done, as I like to keep my lists of hosted sites clean and manageable. If deployment is needed in the future, it should be taken care from the ground up, but the same method can be followed.
